A few weeks ago, I had to create an extension function - a usual task for any Kotlin developer. But there were a few limitations:
* The receiver was a common type, polluted with too many methods.
* The extension function was only relevant to my feature package.
* Creating a ~~Gradle~~ module was out of scope.
* Introducing a new type to hold the function felt like too much.
* [Kotlin doesn't support package-private](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-29227/Provide-package-private-visibility-modifier-or-another-scope-reducing-mechanism), yet.

So how can I have the advantages of using extension functions but avoid these issues?

One way is to use objects as namespace for extension functions.

Here is an example:

```kotlin
// feature/MyFeatureActivityManagers.kt

// Namespace object.
object MyFeatureActivityManagers {

  // Extension functions that are only interested to my feature.
  fun ActivityManager.doSomethingThatOnlyYouCare() = TODO("")
  fun ActivityManager.doSomethingThatOnlyYouCareToo() = TODO("")
}
```

And here is the usage:

```kotlin
// feature/MyFeature.kt

import MyFeatureActivityManagers.doSomethingThatOnlyYouCare

fun myFeature(activityManager: ActivityManager) {
    activityManager.doSomethingThatOnlyYouCare()
}
```

It didn't change much but the approach has a few advantages:
* It ensures that code in the same package can only access the extension function with a direct import;
* It helps humans, and tools, to identify what file the extension is coming from;
* But most important, it has the right level of discoverability*.

What I mean with discoverability is that IntelliJ IDEA seems to have a hierarchy for suggesting auto-complete in the following order:
- Member functions
- Global extensions
- Object extensions

Hence, IDEA will only suggest to other developers your shiny function if they are actively looking for it.

## What's up with the naming?

I want to indicate why these particular functions are related, given the infinite number of possible extensions I could write.

A pattern I find useful is: `{Context}{Receiver}s`, where:

- `Context` groups the functions based on their relevance.
- `Receiver` refers to the type of the receiver for these functions.
- `s` represents the collection of extensions.

## Wrapping up

If you find yourself creating extensions that should be limited in access, consider creating a namespace object for them. That will help your project with organization and readability.
