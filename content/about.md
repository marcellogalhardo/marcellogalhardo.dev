Software engineer with over 7 years of experience with Android. I have been building software professionally since 2012, starting on Web and Backend, later on Desktop, and finally, on Android. I worked with small teams at [Quandoo](https://www.quandoo.com), to dozens of engineers working on the same codebase at [N26](https://n26.com) and [Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com). At [N26](https://n26.com), I worked on the Consumer App and later led the Android Platform Team. The apps I worked on had millions of downloads used in more than 20 countries.

Currently, I work in the [Android System UI Team](https://adbackstage.libsyn.com/episode-187-system-ui-a-retrospective) at [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google) in London.

I am a moderator of the [Android Dev BR](https://androiddevbr.org) community, the largest network of Android developers in Brazil.
